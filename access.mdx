# Access Control

Access control is allowed to be configured on the various operations on data of the app: create, read, update, and delete.
You can either provide a function to do any type of check you want, or you can provide a list of user roles that are allowed to
perform the action.

If using a function to check access, that function is passed in two arguments:

- user
  - The currently authenticated user
- result
  - The doc(s) that are being affected by the operation.
