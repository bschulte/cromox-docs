# Authentication

Cromox allows for multiple types of authentication. By default, only local authentication is enabled. When creating the app,
you can specify all the types of authentication you want to allow. The provided methods so far are:

- Local
- Google
- Facebook
- Github
- Twitch

When providing your choices to the app, it would look like:

```javascript
const zCloud = new ZephyrCloud({
  ...
  authStrategies: ["local", "google", "facebook", "github", "twitch"],
});
```

The local authentication is provided via the GraphQL app, but the 3rd party methods are provided via standard HTTP routes.
The routes are provided as:

`/auth/${authType}`

If a user doesn't exist with the given login methods ID, one is created by default.
