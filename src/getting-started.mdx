# Getting Started

Getting started with Zephyr Cloud takes only a few steps to get working with multiple
types of data with a whole suite of supporting infrastructure surrounding it.

First, you need to instantiate the main cloud app object:

```javascript
const zCloud = new ZephyrCloud({
  dbString: "mongodb://localhost:27017/zephyr",
  authStrategies: ["local"],
});
```

The only required parameter you need to pass is the database string to connect to your MongoDB database.

After you this is done, you can begin adding on lists to the application.

```javascript
zCloud.createList("Thing", {
  fields: {
    name: {
      description: "Name of the best thing ever",
      fieldType: Text,
      unique: true,
    },
    count: {
      fieldType: Float,
    },
  },
});
```

The heart of lists are the fields that represent the data in the list. See the <Link href="#">Test</Link>
