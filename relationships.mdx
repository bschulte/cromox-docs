# Relationships

Lists don't have to exist in isolation. You can have lists be related to one another in the same way you
would noramlly structure data in a database.

You can create a list that will be created as a subdocument to another list with:

```javascript
zCloud.createSubList("SubThing", {
  fields: {
    title: {
      fieldType: Text,
    },
  },
});
```

**Important**
A sublist that will be related to another list _must_ be declared before it.

Once a sublist is declared, a list can then reference it with a particular type of field: `Relationship`
This would look something like:

```javascript
  zCloud.createList("Thing", {
    ...

    fields: {
      ...
      subThings: {
        fieldType: Relationship,
        ref: "SubThing",
        isMany: true,
      },
    },
  });
```

You can use the `ref` attribute to specify the name of the field that will be created for the relationship.

As with all fields, you can specify the `isMany` flag to dictate if the field should be an array of the type or not.
