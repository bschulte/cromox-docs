# Getting Started

Getting started with Cromox takes only a few steps to get working with multiple
types of data with a whole suite of supporting infrastructure surrounding it.

First, you need to instantiate the main cloud app object:

The heart of lists are the fields that represent the data in the list. See the list documentation for more information.

```javascript
const cCloud = new Cromox({
  dbString: "mongodb://localhost:27017/cromox",
  authStrategies: ["local"],
});
```

The only required parameter you need to pass is the database string to connect to your MongoDB database.

After you this is done, you can begin adding on lists to the application.

```javascript
cCloud.createList("Thing", {
  fields: {
    name: {
      description: "Name of the best thing ever",
      fieldType: Text,
      unique: true,
    },
    count: {
      fieldType: Float,
    },
  },
});
```

The heart of lists are the fields that represent the data in the list. See the Fields documentation for more information.

## Adding Lifecycle Hooks

For each list we can hook into various parts of data reading/manipulation. Let's say we want to add a `console.log` statement
before a document is created.

```javascript
cCloud.createList("Thing", {
  fields: {
    name: {
      description: "Name of the best thing ever",
      fieldType: Text,
      unique: true,
    },
    count: {
      fieldType: Float,
    },
  },
  hooks: {
    preChange: async ({ list, args, isNew }) => {
      if (isNew) {
        console.log("Pre create for list:", list.name, "Args:", args);
      }
    },
  },
});
```

The `preChange` hook passes in `isNew` which will represent if the operation is a create or update.

## Adding Access Control

Along with lifecycle hooks, we can define access controls for the operations or create, read, update, and delete.

Say we want to only allow deletion for users who are admins:

```javascript
cCloud.createList("Thing", {
  fields: {
    name: {
      description: "Name of the best thing ever",
      fieldType: Text,
      unique: true,
    },
    count: {
      fieldType: Float,
    },
  },
  hooks: {
    preChange: async ({ list, args, isNew }) => {
      if (isNew) {
        console.log("Pre create for list:", list.name, "Args:", args);
      }
    },
  },
  access: {
    delete: async ({ user }) => {
      if (!user || !user.isAdmin) {
        return false;
      }

      return true;
    },
  },
});
```

The access functions provide the currently authenticated user as well as the document(s) that are being affected by the operation.

Access control configs can also be provided an array of authorized roles (strings) to perform the action. In this case, a check is made
to see if the currently authenticated user has any of the provided roles. If not, the operation isn't allowed to continue.
